Code Warriors complete Kata which are assigned a rank, which in turn earns them a higher rank once they complete enough of them. There are two classes of ranks, Kyu and Dan. You begin with Kyu at level 8 and work your way down to level 1. Then you progress to Dan, where you work your way up from level 1 to level 8.

**Some of my codewars solutions:** 
***3kyu:***
- The alpinist (dijkstra)
***4kyu:***
- Path Finding Algorithm

***5kyu:***
